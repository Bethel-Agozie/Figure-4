This code generates the figures for the standard non-dimensional blood flow model Riemann problem using general tube used in the paper.  Ignoring supercritical solutions, which appear as white patches on the figure, a patchwork of different colours, representing different solutions, emerges. Ensure to use the appropriate initial guess that matches the value of m for the classical code.
