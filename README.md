This code generates the figures used in the paper for the standard non-dimensional blood flow model Riemann problem using general tube.  Ignoring supercritical solutions, which appear as white patches on the figure, a patchwork of different colours, representing different solutions, emerges. Ensure to use the appropriate initial guess that matches the value of m for the classical code.
