This code generates Figure 4, a solution space (A_2,u_2) for a standard non-dimensional blood flow model Riemann problem using general tube with a jump in the vessel stiffness k.  Ignoring supercritical solutions, which appear as white patches on the figure, a patchwork of different colours, representing different solutions, emerges.
